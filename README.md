# NeurIPS 2025 - Open Polymer Prediction 

Welcome to the **NeurIPS 2025 Open Polymer Prediction** repository. This repository reflects our team’s ongoing exploration and experimentation as part of our participation in the **NeurIPS 2025 Open Polymer Prediction Challenge**. The goal is to develop a modular, reproducible framework for predicting five key polymer properties directly from SMILES representations: supporting accelerated exploration and discovery in sustainable polymer research.


This challenge is hosted under the **Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025 Competition Track**, part of one of the most highly regarded international conferences in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

NeurIPS 2025 (Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems) will be held in San Diego, California, from December 2 to 7, 2025.
